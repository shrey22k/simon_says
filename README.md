Simon Says is a classic memory game where players must repeat a sequence of colors, sounds, or actions in the exact order they’re presented. 
The game begins with a single cue, and with each successful round, the sequence becomes longer and more complex. Players must focus and react quickly — one mistake, and the game ends!
